If won't random, you can let others pull it.
When the last day, it will go to company.

Just need the host setup this mod.And need host pull the lever when you want to start the ship to other moon.

## Settings

There are 2 ways to config it:
- Normal - Need to know the moons' LevelID and config them manually
	 But it can set the probability of each moon arriving at random.
	 Make sure you know the LevelID.
- Another - Just input the moons which won't to.
	  Default:  It just 2 probability for it : moon's risk is 'A' or 'S'. These moons have 1 weight, others have 5 weight.
                  By 4 days, it will increase 1 weight for those 1 weight moon once.
